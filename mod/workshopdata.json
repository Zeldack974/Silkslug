  "Description": "Homage to a game, a game that sold dreams, hopes, but will never come to be.\r\nThis slugcat is a joke and i hope it becomes obsolete soon.\r\n\r\nThe [b]Slug Song[/b] skin is NOT made by me and was NOT made for this slugcat, it is just recommended for a more immersive experience and all credit goes to its creator.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of this slugcat is the hunter one I believe (I didn\u0027t finish it).\r\nThe slugcat has been tested in the arena.\r\n\r\nLet\u0027s move on to abilities.\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]Any spears picked up by this slugcat will automatically be put on its back, this spear can only be removed by [b][DOWN \u002B PICKUP][/b].\r\n    [*]If both slugcats hands are empty you can use [b][THROW][/b] to attack with a slash.\r\n    [*]The slash direction works like a spear throw, and does everything you can expect: damage, pogo (no E Pogo), parry, plus a bit of stun.\r\n    [*]By using [b][JUMP \u002B PICKUP][/b] you can do a dash (with filled hands or not), the dash does the same damage as the slash but cannot parry projectiles.\r\n[/list]\r\nHappy SHAW and GIT GUD.",
